## About isolate (taratahi) at home

Most people who are COVID-19 positive will have mild symptoms that can be easily managed at home.

They all mean isolating away from other members of your household (eg, have no physical contact, minimise time in shared spaces and do not share items such as cutlery and linen), while you remain in your own home.

## How do I isolate at home when I am COVID-19 positive?

This means you don’t leave your home and you don’t have visitors to your home. This will help stop the virus from spreading. Being in isolation can be really hard, especially if you live with other people, or in smaller spaces. Read more about preparing for having COVID-19 in your home.
